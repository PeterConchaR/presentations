Telerik Kendo UI
==========

#### Presentation-In-a-Box .. You'll enjoy this.

Everything you need to present on Telerik Kendo UI - nicely wrapped up in a box. Showcases framework features and highlights UI widgets for an easy conversation with developers.

### /// 20 Minute Cameo

If you have a short amount of time to do a lightning talk on Kendo UI, here’s what we think are the most important points to hit:

* Start with web development today .. lots of JS frameworks, need for mobile etc.
* Go through the Kendo UI deck
* Slides will highlight UI widgets and framework features
* Show the Kendo UI widgets in action in the interactive demos
* Don't dive into demo code .. samples shown in the deck should be enough
* Stress on Kendo UI's everything-in-a-package benefits
* Highlight flexibility and wrap-up

### /// 25-60 Minute Presentation

Ah, the comfort zone of a regular User Group or Conference session! Here’s what might make sense:

* Start with web development today .. lots of JS frameworks, need for mobile etc.
* Go through the Kendo UI deck
* Slides will highlight UI widgets and framework features
* Show the Kendo UI widgets in action in the interactive demos
* Dive into demo code through Kendo UI Dojo .. walk through sample code
* Show Kendo UI Dojo in action and highlight how easy it is to play
* Use Kendo UI demos to show Mobile specific widgets
* Show framework features (MVVM, SPA etc.) in action through Kendo UI demos
* Show Theme Builder in action
* Briefly show the Kendo UI docs & forums pages
* Stress on Kendo UI's everything-in-a-package benefits
* Highlight flexibility and wrap-up

### /// Have fun
