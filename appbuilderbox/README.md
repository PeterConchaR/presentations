Telerik AppBuilder
==========

#### Presentation-In-a-Box .. You'll enjoy this.

Everything you need to present on Telerik AppBuilder - nicely wrapped up in a box. Showcases features and highlights tooling for an easy conversation with developers.

### /// 20 Minute Cameo

If you have a short amount of time to do a lightning talk on X-platform hybrid mobile development and Telerik AppBuilder, here’s what we think are the most important points to hit:

* Quickly explain mobile strategies (mobile web, native or hybrid)
* Explain where Telerik AppBuilder fits with hybrid mobile development
* Showcase tooling through flexibility of IDEs
* Stick to the slide decks entirely and walk through options
* Cover In-browser client, Then pick one (from: CLI, Sublime Text, Visual Studio) IDE integration
* Show quick build/deployment using Companion app and QR code scanner
* Mention Plugins Marketplace
* Highlight flexibility and wrap-up

### /// 25-60 Minute Presentation

Ah, the comfort zone of a regular User Group or Conference session! Here’s what might make sense:

* Start with mobile strategies (mobile web, native or hybrid)
* Emphasize where hybrid approach makes sense
* Explain roots of Apache Cordova and what PhoneGap means
* Show the gaps and then introduce Telerik AppBuilder
* Stress on flexibility of IDEs and build/deploy ease
* Run through the deck fully or feel free to jump out to show & tell
* Demo In-browser client with project creation through templates
* Show In-browser simulators
* Demo adaptive rendering with Kendo UI Mobile
* Create same project with OSX/Windows CLI and launch native simulators
* Open CLI-created project with Sublime Text to show integration
* Go back to In-browser to demo builds
* Walk-through Companion app deployment through QR code scanning
* Mention app package deployments and device/provisioning setups
* Show Bower integration & package management
* Walkthrough Visual Studio integration and native Windows simulators
* Show Plugins Marketplace and show integration in IDEs
* Highlight flexibility of tooling & wrap up

### /// Have fun

Hope you enjoy building X-platform hybrid mobile apps as much as we do. Telerik AppBuilder provides mobile developers end-to-end tooling for success and hopefully, this presentation-in-a-box content helps you share your passion.

And remember - you're awesome. We mean that.
